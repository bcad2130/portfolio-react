    <p>Hello! My name is <b>Bretton Cadigan</b> and I'm a full-stack software engineer looking for new work opportunities to learn, collaborate, and grow.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>I live in the Jamaica Plain area of Boston, MA and am open to in-person / hybrid work opportunities as well as remote work.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>I've worked on many different tech stacks in professional settings:
      <ul>
        <li>TypeScript / Javascript with Node and Express hosted on AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB)</li>
        <li>C# on Unity (Video game cross-platform engine with C# Scripting API)</li>
        <li>PHP with MySQL (LAMP for web applications) </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Outside of professional work, I like to take classes to learn new skills and enjoy working on personal projects. I've made a handful of video games on the Unity platform. I have built a few websites and web applications with more in-progress.</p>
    <br/>

    <p> When I'm not coding, I enjoy writing fiction, especially speculative fiction and horror, drawing and reading graphic novels, performing on stage sketch comedy, and playing strategy board games.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>I'm a bit more extroverted than your typical engineer and love meeting and connecting with new people. I'm naturally curious, and frequently absorbed in my latest hobby obsession. My friends have described me as "really funny". I once shook hands with Barack Obama. What more do you need to know?</p>
